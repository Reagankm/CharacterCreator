Other reagents do exist._ Low grade alchemical items are not difficult to find. They can be gathered from dozens of different places on the Material Plane. For instance; low grade alchemical water can come from a specific natural spring at the base of a mountain; while low grade alchemical air may be the air blowing through a specific mountain pass. Medium grade alchemical items are more difficult to find and will typically come from a place that has more significance. For example; medium grade alchemical water may be found in a small pond blessed by a fey creature deep in an ancient forest; while medium grade alchemical earth may be the crushed heart of a dead stone giant. High grade alchemical reagents are very difficult to acquire and will almost always require travel to a different plane. Traveling to the elemental planes is the best way to acquire high grade elemental alchemical reagents._ Alchemical formulas must be learned. Each alchemical item can have up to 8 different formulas; one for each status. When you learn the alchemical formula for an alchemical item; you learn all the formulas for the item. Notebooks with alchemical formulas are very valuable. Alchemical formulas contain at least two reagents of a specific grade and quantity._ Standard reagent requirements per status_ Initiate: 2 low_ Novice: 3 low_ Apprentice: 1 medium; 2 low_ Teacher: 2 medium_ Journeyman: 3 medium_ Expert: 1 high; 2 medium_ Master: 2 high_ Grand Master: 3 high_ When you declare that you are attempting to craft an alchemical item; you must declare the status you are attempting to craft. When you make your Alchemy check at the end of the process; you will have successfully crafted an item of the status of your roll; meaning that you can create an item of a lower status than you attempted (don't forget auto-success on failed checks; see checks in Chapter 2). You will expend the reagents for the attempted status regardless of the outcome of the check; and you cannot produce an item with a status higher than the attempted status._ Some alchemical items may have special; non-standard reagents._ All creatures trained in Alchemy know the formulas for the following three items: alchemist's fire grenade; restore stamina potion; and restore health potion.",0,0,FALSE,FALSEArchitecture (Int),Focus,Int,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSEArmorsmithing (Int),Focus,Int,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSEArmorsmithing (Str),Focus,Str,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSEBowmaking (Dex),Focus,Dex,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,The fletching of arrows is included,0,0,FALSE,FALSEBowmaking (Int),Focus,Int,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,The fletching of arrows is included,0,0,FALSE,FALSEBlacksmithing (Int),Focus,Int,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSEBlacksmithing (Str),Focus,Str,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSECarpentry (Int),Focus,Int,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSECarpentry (Str),Focus,Str,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSECobbling (Dex),Focus,Dex,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSECobbling (Int),Focus,Int,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSEEngineering (Int),Focus,Int,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,0,0,FALSE,FALSEGemcutting (Dex),Focus,Dex,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,"_ Gems come in three different qualities: uncut; cut; and polished._ An uncut gem is basically a gem just taken out of the ground.
