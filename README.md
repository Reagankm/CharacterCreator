# CharactorCreator
A character creator for my friend's unpublished tabletop RPG

This is my first attempt at creating a repository on GitHub so I apologize if anything was done incorrectly.

This program was created using Visual Studio 2008.

To run it, download the Support Files (which are csv files the program uses to load things like weapons, stats, and dice) 
and take note of where you save it.  The program itself is under the name FionnCharacterCreator.  After you load it into 
Visual Studio, just change the filepath for the constants to point to where you saved the Support Files on your computer.
(I'm sure there must be a way to include these with the Visual Studio project to avoid this extra step but I haven't found
it yet.  Sorry for the hack-y fix in the meantime.)
